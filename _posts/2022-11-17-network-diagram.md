_Your standard home network.._

Here is my home network. Everything is tied to the Netgear mesh router, which consists of one main unit and two satellite access points. The satellite units help with coverage on the property, but since it's still all one network, things will start to become limited if there are any high-bandwidth apps/streaming/etc. Additional satellite APs can be added later to further extend coverage. 

I wanted to get this documented, because today I scored my future [pfsense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PfSense) firewall, a [HP 290-p0043w](https://forums.serverbuilds.net/t/official-hp-290-p0043w-owners-thread/2829) for $100. Woohoo! That device will allow me to properly build out the home network with VLANs, firewalls, and a bunch of other fancy stuff. Honestly I don't know a whole lot about the software at this point. I just know I need to better carve out the home network if I want to have things like tons of wifi-enabled sensors, with security cameras, with streaming gaming, all running smoothly.
