## Here's Our Current Network
![Network-Diagram-2022](netdiag_20221122.jpg)
_Your standard home network?.._

As you can see, everything is tied to the Netgear mesh router, which consists of one main unit and two satellite access points ([APs](https://www.linksys.com/what-is-a-wifi-access-point.html)). The satellite units help with coverage on the property, but since it's still all one network, things will start to become limited if there are any high-bandwidth apps/streaming/etc. Additional satellite APs can be added later to further extend coverage. 

I wanted to get this documented, because today I scored my future [pfsense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PfSense) firewall, a [HP 290-p0043w](https://forums.serverbuilds.net/t/official-hp-290-p0043w-owners-thread/2829) for $100. Woohoo! That device will allow me to properly build out the home network with VLANs, firewalls, and a bunch of other fancy stuff. Honestly I don't know a whole lot about the software at this point. I just know I need to better carve out the home network if I want to have things like tons of wifi-enabled sensors, with security cameras, with streaming gaming, all running smoothly.

You'll also probably notice that long list of containers on the left. I'll detail those more in another post.
