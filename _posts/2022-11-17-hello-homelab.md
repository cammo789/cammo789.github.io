# Welcome

Aloha and welcome to my homelab documentation site!

This will be my attempt to document the inner workings of my homelab so that I can better communicate how these systems work with each other. This will be mostly internal but I may use it as reference for family and friends. I doubt anyone outside the IT field will have fun reading this, but for what it's worth, have fun!

Most of this I pieced together during Covid lockdown from Slickdeals, serverbuilds.net, perfectmediaserver.com, and the Self Hosted podcast. Shout out to all those folks for their amazing resources! 

## Hardware

Here is my current hardware setup:

##### Lenovo ThinkCentre M90n i5-8365U 8GB RAM (plex transcoder)
