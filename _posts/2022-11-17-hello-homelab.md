# Welcome

Hello and welcome to my homelab docs site!

This will be my attempt to document the inner workings of my homelab, learn markdown, and overall learn how to better communicate what these systems do, at a high and low level. This will be mostly internal but I may use it as reference for family or friends. I doubt anyone will have fun reading this but for what it's worth, have fun!

## Hardware

Here is my current hardware setup

* one
* two
* three
* four

```javascript
console.log('hello world!');
```

```yml
name: 'push-remote'

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
    paths-ignore:
      - .gitignore
      - README.md
      - LICENSE
```

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```
