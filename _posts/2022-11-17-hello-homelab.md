# Welcome

Aloha and welcome to my homelab documentation site!

This will be my attempt to document the inner workings of my homelab so that I can better communicate how these systems work with each other. This will be mostly internal but I may use it as reference for family, friends and colleagues. I doubt anyone outside the IT field will enjoy reading this, but for what it's worth, have fun!

Most of this I pieced together during Covid lockdown from Slickdeals using info from serverbuilds.net, perfectmediaserver.com, and the Self-Hosted podcast. Shout out to all those folks for their amazing resources! 

I plan to keep expanding this. The next goal is to continue buildling out the proxmox server with Windows Active Directory. 

I am also close to ordering hardware for a pfsense router. I figure before I deploy all these [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) devices, I should to get my network properly layed out so as to not unintentionally bottleneck it in the future. Most importantly, I want to play with Christmas lights!

console.log('Aloha Homelab!');
